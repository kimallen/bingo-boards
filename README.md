# bingo-boards
Built in Ruby/Sinatra (note: this app is being transferred and continued as a Rails app called scavenger-bingo)

This app will allow a user to create a bingo board using self-chosen grid statements for a 25 square grid.  
The game is a bit like "I spy" using a bingo board and can be used at different events or settings.  

The board designer can create the board theme and clues and the program will randomly create boards with the inputs in different squares.
The designer can designate friends to whom to text a url to a randomly generated board in the chosen theme.

The board can be marked as each item is found.  Other users will be notified when a player completes a row.
